# cppFibExercise
Small project to play around with and use Fibonacci sequences as a means to keep up on C++ development.

Note that a basic implementation of Fibonacci sequence can be implemented in just a few lines. (See the first few commits.) For practice, will continue to iterate on the abstractions and separation of concerns.

For simplicity, this project will include xcode project and build information to start.
